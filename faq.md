# Frequently asked questions!
- **Q:** Why do you hate Discord?
- It's a joke.
- **Q:** How do I run the bot 24/7?
- It's not suggested to do this, but remove the `process.exit(0)` inside of `index.js` and the bot will not shut itself down.
- **Q:** Why did you make this? Now a bunch of people who don't even know how to code have the badge!
- The real question is, why do you care about who has a stupid SVG on their profile?
- **Q:** Won't this help scam people?
- Not entirely, the goal of this repo is to allow every single Discord user and their mother to get the badge, so that it is seen as useless.
