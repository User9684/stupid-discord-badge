# Please, do not use this to spam requests to either Discord or Replit, for they both are seeming to struggle with this.

## I hate Discord so I made this
<b> **Please consider reading the [FAQ](./faq) before opening issues.**

### How to use
#### Getting your token
- Create an application at the [Developer panel](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) (or you can use a previously existing one)
- Make it into a bot if it isn't already one
- Click "regenerate token" and then copy it
#### Hosting the bot

#### Repl.It (not recommended)
- To host on Repl.it, create an application via this [template](https://replit.com/new/github/User9684/stupid-discord-badge)
- Run the command `npm run run BOT_TOKEN_HERE` (replace (BOT_TOKEN_HERE with your [token](#getting-your-token)) inside the "Shell" tab

#### Glitch
- Open up [Glitch's](https://glitch.com/) website
- Click "New Project"
- Click "Import from github"
- Paste in `https://github.com/User9684/stupid-discord-badge.git` to the popup given
- Open the "Terminal" tab, and use the command `npm run run BOT_TOKEN_HERE` (replace BOT_TOKEN_HERE with your [token](#getting-your-token))

#### Selfhosting
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Create a new directory on your system
- Open up any terminal
- Run the command `git clone https://github.com/User9684/stupid-discord-badge.git && cd stupid-discord-badge`
- Finally, run the command `npm run run BOT_TOKEN_HERE` (replace BOT_TOKEN_HERE with your [token](#getting-your-token))

#### Getting the badge
- Once your bot is running, invite it using the URL put into console (will be logged once it is fully running)
- Use the `/lol` command
- If your bot is brand new, you will need to wait up to 24h for your bot to be fully registered as "active"
- Once you are eligible, get the badge at the [Application site](https://discord.com/developers/active-developer)
