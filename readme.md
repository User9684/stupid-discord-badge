# I hate Discord so I made this

### How to use
- Create an application at the [Developer panel](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) (or you can use a previously existing one)
- Make it into a bot if it isn't already one
- Obtain your token
- Go to the dock tab in the bottom left of the replit window
- Click on secrets
- Type `token` into the key field
- Paste your token into the value field
- Then on the left side of the replit window click ok (there should be like a field with `npm run start` text in it, the button is below that)
- Then click on the big green run button in the top middle of the window
- Invite the bot using the URL put into console
- Use the `/lol` command
- If your bot is brand new, you will need to wait up to 24h for your bot to be fully registered as "active"
- Once you are eligible, get the badge at the [Application site](https://discord.com/developers/active-developer)
